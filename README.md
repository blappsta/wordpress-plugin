#Wordpress Plugin to support Blappsta Apps

[Blappsta](www.blappsta.com) offers Apps based on Wordpress sites and blogs. 
The plugin to be used in Wordpress can be found here: http://wordpress.org/plugins/yournewsapp/

Since [Blappsta](www.blappsta.com) is a very powerfull App framework we cannot rely on RSS feeds only. We have created this repository in case you like to participate in adding features to the plugin.

Contributions to the plugin will be tested and then integrated into our Wordpress Plugin update.
We will grant contributors free of charge usage of Blappsta based on the level of contribution.
